# NICU Medication Utilization Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes medication usage data from a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to identify patterns, cost drivers, and areas for improvement in drug inventory management. Using SQL and Excel, I explored high-frequency and high-cost medications, time-based usage trends, and opportunities for standardization. The goal is to support data-driven decisions that improve operational efficiency and reduce medication costs in a clinical pharmacy setting.

## Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Excel
- Epic Willow (for medication tracking context)
- MedKeeper (for IV compounding support)

## Key Objectives
- Identify the top 10 most-used medications in the NICU
- Analyze cost distribution across medications
- Explore usage trends by time of day and patient group
- Recommend process improvements to reduce waste

## Summary of Findings
- 3 drugs accounted for over 60% of total NICU med costs
- Standardizing doses of certain medications could save over $4,000/month
- Opportunity to align Omnicell stock levels with demand trends

## Next Steps
- Automate reporting for pharmacy leadership
- Develop dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
- Integrate insights with MedKeeper for compounding workflow optimization
